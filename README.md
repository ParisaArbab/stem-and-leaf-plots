This code defines a Python program for generating and displaying stem-and-leaf plots based on data read from text files. Here's a summary of its functionality:

Greet User: The greet_user function prints a welcome message, introducing the user to the Stem and Leaf Plot program.

Get User Input: The get_user_input function prompts the user to select a data file by inputting a number (1, 2, or 3) or to exit the program by typing 'exit'. This input is returned as a string.

Read Data: The read_data function takes a filename as input, reads integers from each line of the file, and returns a list of these integers. It's designed to work with files where each line contains a single integer.

Determine Stem and Leaf Digits: The determine_stem_leaf_digits function calculates the sizes of stems and leaves based on the maximum value in the data. However, this functionality seems to be defined but not used in the main program flow.

Create Stem and Leaf Plot: The create_stem_and_leaf_plot function generates the plot from the list of integers. It organizes the data into stems and leaves, where each stem represents the leading digits of the numbers, and the leaves represent the last digit. This data is stored in a dictionary.

Display Plot: The display_plot function prints the stem-and-leaf plot in a readable format. Each stem is shown alongside its leaves, separated by a vertical bar.

Main Function: This is where the program's logic is orchestrated. After greeting the user, it enters a loop where it continually asks for user input. Depending on the input, it either exits the program, reads data from a specified file to generate and display a stem-and-leaf plot, or prompts the user again if an invalid option is entered. The path to the data files is constructed dynamically based on the user's choice.

Error Handling and Feedback: The program includes basic error handling by informing the user when an invalid choice is made or when a specified data file does not exist. It encourages the user to try again with correct input.

Program Loop: The main function runs in a loop, allowing the user to generate multiple plots or exit the program as desired.

In essence, this program is a practical application of data visualization, specifically designed to teach or reinforce the concept of stem-and-leaf plots. It integrates file handling, user input, and basic data processing to create an educational and interactive tool.
